*Incomplete
*Did not get spinner to select month and then display data for that month
*Edit screen does change the values in firebase but does not update the details screen 
*Monthly breakdown screen does not display data but does show graph with hard coded data, was not able to get proper data to load into breakdown screen
*These features were missed because I ran out of time, Working with firebase query to get my data really put me behind

*BUGS
*On return from editing tip data to the list removes that date, still bugs to work out with edit screen
*When testing on simulator add crashes if no activity for so long and sometimes on return of adding tip data, does not happen when tested on device
